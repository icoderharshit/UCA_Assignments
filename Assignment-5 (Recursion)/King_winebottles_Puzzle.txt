Problem Statement ->
King has 1000 bottles of wine to be consumed in a party after 7 days. Palace guards found one of the bottles was poisoned by a spy. 
King wants rest 999 bottles in the party and for that the poisonous bottle has to be identified and discarded. King has given 10 prisoners 
whom you can test. You have to find a strategy to identify the poisonous bottles using these 10 prisoners. 
Below are a few key points to design a strategy. 
1. Bottles are of infinite capacity - you can take out any amount for testing
2. Even if you drink single drop of whole bottle you will die but in exactly 7 days
3. You don't care about the lives of these 10 prisoners. 


Solution ->
Number the bottles 1 to 1000 and write the number in binary format.

bottle 1 = 0000000001 (10 digit binary)
bottle 2 = 0000000010
bottle 500 = 0111110100
bottle 1000 = 1111101000

Now take 10 prisoners and number them 1 to 10, now let prisoner 1 take a sip from every bottle that has a 1 in its least significant bit. 
Let prisoner 10 take a sip from every bottle with a 1 in its most significant bit and so on.

prisoner = 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
bottle 924 = 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0

For example, bottle no. 924 would be sipped by 10,9,8,5,4 and 3. That way if bottle no. 924 was the poisoned one, only those prisoners would die.
After 7 days, line the prisoners up in their bit order and read each living prisoner as a 0 bit and each dead prisoner as a 1 bit. 
The number that you get is the bottle of wine that was poisoned.
1000 is less than 1024 (2^10). If there were 1024 or more bottles of wine it would take more than 10 prisoners.
